# Repurpose-tech
Repurpose older ODROID devices as learning tools

I took previous equipment that was going to be sent out to be collected and recycled and decided to repurpose them. I took it as a learning opportunity on working with System on a Chip Technology that was free and easy to use.

# Equipment Used

I used ODROID C2 devices along with a MicroSD adaptor, 16 GB Micro SD cards, and balenaEtcher.

# Kali Image via ODROID
This image required me taking and creating the image myself as all the rest of the images were already created and ready for upload to each Micro SD card
